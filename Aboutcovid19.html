<h1>What is Covid19?</h1>
    <p>Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Because it is a new virus, scientists are learning more each day. Although most people who have COVID-19 have mild symptoms, COVID-19 can also cause severe illness and even death. Some groups, including older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions, are at increased risk of severe illness.
    
    About the Name
    On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV.”</p>
   
   <p> <mark> <u> Source of the Virus</u><br>
    Coronaviruses, named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. There are many types of human coronaviruses, including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
    
    Animal coronaviruses rarely infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with two earlier coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
    
    virus is a beta coronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These viruses have their origins in bats. Although we do not know the exact source of the current outbreak of COVID-19, we know that it originally came from an animal, likely a bat. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
