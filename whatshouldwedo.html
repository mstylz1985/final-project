    <h1>Preventing the spread of the coronavirus</h1>
    <h2>Physical distancing, masks, and other preventive measures</h2>
    <p>You've gotten the basics down: you're wearing your mask, avoiding crowds, and keeping your distance from friends and family. But you likely still have questions. Does wearing a mask protect you, others, or both? How exactly will physical distancing help? And what do you need to know about the new COVID-19 vaccines?</p>
<br>
<h1>What can I do to protect myself and others from COVID-19?</h1>
<p>The following actions help prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses and influenza:
<ul>
    <li> Wear a face mask.</li>
    <li>Maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and others.</li>
    <li>Avoid large gatherings.</li>
    <li>Socialize outdoors.</li> 
    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
    <li> Minimize touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
    <li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
    <li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
    <li>Clean frequently touched objects and surfaces regularly.</li>
    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water.</li>
    <li>Get vaccinated as soon as you are eligible.</li>  
</ul>
</p>
<p>That chart illustrates how protective measures such as limiting travel, avoiding crowds, social distancing, and thorough and frequent handwashing can slow down the development of new COVID-19 cases and reduce the risk of overwhelming the health care system.

    <h1>What do I need to know about washing my hands effectively?</h1>
    Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; and after handling anything that's come from outside your home.
    
    If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.
    Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
    The CDC's handwashing website has detailed instructions and a video about effective handwashing procedures.
    <h1>How does coronavirus spread?</h1>
    The coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person. This can happen between people who are in close contact with one another. Droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes may land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs.
    
    A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air for up to three hours. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the coronavirus. This is why everyone should wear a mask when they go out in public.
    
    The risk of spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects is considered to be low. According to the CDC, each contact with a contaminated surface has less than a 1 in 10,000 chance of causing an infection.
    
    The virus may be shed in saliva, semen, and feces; whether it is shed in vaginal fluids isn't known. Kissing can transmit the virus. Transmission of the virus through feces, or during vaginal or anal intercourse or oral sex, appears to be extremely unlikely at this time.
    
    <h1>How could contact tracing help slow the spread of COVID-19?</h1>    
    Anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has COVID-19 is at increased risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially infecting others. Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.
    
    Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious. In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms.
    
    The contacts are notified about their exposure. They may be told what symptoms to look out for, advised to isolate themselves for a period of time, and to seek medical attention as needed if they start to experience symptoms.
    
   <h1> What is physical distancing and why is it important?</h1>
    The COVID-19 virus primarily spreads when one person breathes in droplets or aerosols that are produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes.
    
    Physical distancing refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance (6 feet or more) between yourself and another person to avoid getting infected or infecting someone else. School closures, directives to work from home, library closings, and cancelling meetings and larger events help enforce physical distancing at a community level.
    
    Slowing down the rate and number of new coronavirus infections is critical to reduce the risk that large numbers of critically ill patients cannot receive life-saving care.
    
    <h1>What does the CDC's new definition of "close contacts" mean for me?</h1>
    The CDC has expanded how it defines close contacts of someone with COVID-19. Until this point, the CDC had defined a close contact as someone who spent 15 or more consecutive minutes within six feet of someone with COVID-19. According to the new definition, a close contact is someone who spends 15 minutes or more within six feet of a person with COVID-19 over a period of 24 hours.
    
    Close contacts are at increased risk of infection. When a person tests positive for COVID-19, contact tracers may identify their close contacts and urge them to quarantine to prevent further spread. Based on the new definition, more people will now be considered close contacts.
    
    Many factors can affect the chances that infection will spread from one person to another. These factors include whether or one or both people are wearing masks, whether the infected person is coughing or showing other symptoms, and whether the encounter occurred indoors or outdoors. Though the "15 minutes within six feet rule" is a helpful guideline, it's always best to minimize close interactions with people who are not members of your household.
    
    The CDC's new definition was influenced by a case described in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in which a correctional officer in Vermont is believed to have been infected after being within six feet for 17 non-consecutive minutes of six asymptomatic individuals, all of whom later tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
